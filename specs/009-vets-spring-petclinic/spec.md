**Feature Branch**: `[###-vets-for-spring-petclinic]`

**Created**: 2026-09-01

**Status**: Draft

**Input**: User description: "vets for spring-petclinic"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View Vet List (Priority: P1)

As a clinic administrator or visitor, I want to see a list of all veterinarians so that I can understand the available expertise.

**Why this priority**: This is a core piece of information for users interacting with the clinic.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating to the vets list page and verifying that all known vets are displayed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the vets module is accessible, **When** a user navigates to the vets list page, **Then** all veterinarians are displayed.

### User Story 2 - View Vet Details (Priority: P2)

As a clinic administrator or visitor, I want to view the details of a specific veterinarian, including their specialties, so that I can understand their qualifications.

**Why this priority**: Provides more in-depth information about individual vets.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by selecting a vet from the list and verifying their displayed information.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a specific vet exists, **When** a user views the vet's profile, **Then** their first name, last name, and specialties are displayed.

### User Story 3 - Vet Serialization (Priority: P3)

As a system component, I want to ensure that Vet objects can be reliably serialized and deserialized, so that data integrity is maintained across operations.

**Why this priority**: Ensures the underlying data model is robust.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a Vet object, serializing it, deserializing it, and comparing the original and deserialized objects.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a Vet object is created, **When** it is serialized and deserialized, **Then** the Vet object retains its original first name, last name, and ID.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a vet has no specialties?
- How does the system handle invalid data for vet names or specialties?
